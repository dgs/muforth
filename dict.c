 * Trying a fundamental change to the text interpreter. Instead of only

 * search first "current" (the chain we are compiling into) and only if

 * search .forth.
 *
 * This should make creating assemblers and target compilers easier, since
 * we won't have to be quite as explicit about "quoting" - eg with \a -
 * words defined in current that we want to refer to (ie, compile).
 *
 * Here's how it works: search current. If found, or if current == .forth.
